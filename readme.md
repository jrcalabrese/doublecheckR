## doublecheckR

I created this tool to better facilitate the task of resolving coding discrepancies for behavioral coding projects. Please note that as of June 1st 2022, this tool is specifically designed for one of my lab's projects so your data will not work on it as the tool specifically selects variables present in my coding sheets. However, I plan to update this in the future so researchers can manually specify which columns/row to select.
